  
Filmtastic represents a virtual movie library that presents both parts of the cast and infomation about the movies.
In order to create this I used Android Studio and libraries such as Picasso.
To create the database I used Firestore and for the authentication I used Firebase Authentication. 
I am able to log into the application, create a new user and add new details into the database.
I am also able to show how many documents I have into a collection and to display at least one document. 
If you want to try to log yourself try: Email => poison_ivy@gmail.com, Password => thegreen.
